DATA BACKUP project

Note - I have rhel for this project

We know how lazy we can be when it comes to creating proper backup. Using Github is a good solution, but let's be honest how many of us actually use it properly. 

This Project aims at automating the task of backup. The project , will itself add the newly created files to the staging area. It automatically commits it and automatically pushes it to the repository.


Once you setup the repository in both GitHub and GIT, you can run the following command to automate the backup

command- chmod o+x Git*
command- crontab -u root crontab
